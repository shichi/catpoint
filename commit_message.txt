feat: Implement "Go to Slide" functionality and fix shift-wheel scrolling

This commit introduces a "Go to Slide" button in the presentation view, allowing users to directly navigate to a specific slide number. This feature is implemented within the renderer process to avoid complex IPC interactions with the main process menu.

Additionally, this commit includes fixes for shift-wheel scrolling, ensuring proper horizontal navigation when the shift key is pressed.

Resolved issues:
- Shift-wheel scrolling not functioning correctly.
- Blank screen issues caused by previous attempts at dynamic menu population and animation skipping.
