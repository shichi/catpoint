feat: Improve mouse interaction and pointer display in presentation

This commit addresses several issues related to mouse interaction and custom pointer display within the CatPoint application:

- Ensures mouse events (mousemove, contextmenu, wheel) from iframes are correctly propagated to the main process and handled by the renderer process.
- Fixes the custom mouse pointer and drawing marker position discrepancies by accurately mapping iframe-relative coordinates to main document absolute coordinates.
- Resolves the issue where the custom mouse pointer was not visible over HTML content by removing the `mix-blend-mode` CSS property.
- Implements clearing of drawing lines when navigating between slides.
- Corrects the `path` module import in `preload.js` and handles path resolution via the main process to comply with Electron's security best practices.
